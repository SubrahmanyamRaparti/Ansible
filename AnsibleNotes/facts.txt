With Ansible you can retrieve or discover certain variables containing information about your remote systems or 
about Ansible itself. Variables related to remote systems are called facts. With facts, you can use the behavior
or state of one system as configuration on other systems.

Facts:
    \_ Default facts
    \_ Custom facts

ansible localhost -i inventory.txt -m setup

Steps to create custom ansible facts
=> Create directory /etc/ansible/facts.d on the ansible managed nodes
=> Create a python or bash script to program with extension <program name>.fact
=> Output of the program should be in json format
=> Give execution permission

Example:
$ ansible localhost -i inventory.txt -m file -a "path=/etc/ansible/facts.d state=directory" --become
$ ansible localhost -i inventory.txt -m copy -a "src=../CustomFacts/ansible_package_versions.fact 
  dest=/etc/ansible/facts.d/ mode=0755" --become
$ ansible localhost -i inventory.txt -m setup -a "filter=ansible_local"
